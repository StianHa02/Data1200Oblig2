        <p class="paragraph1">This picture was taken during a road trip to Aalesund.
            This picture shows my brother, Antony, and in front of him is the beautiful city of Geiranger.<br>
            Antony was the main driver for the trip, and we can clearly see that he was tired from the driving because he would rather look at his phone than the magnificent view from the vantage point.
