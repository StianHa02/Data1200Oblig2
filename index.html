                 <p>The picture is taken in Mandals elva on a rainy day in summer 2021. Summer season in
                      Norway is a bit different from the summer other people think. It's not as hot as it
                      should be and the average temperature in Norway is around 25 Celsius.

                <h2>Fetsund Lenser</h2>
                 <p>We visited Fetsund Lenser in the summer. Here I will tell you some information about this place.
                    The Fetsund lenser is a Norwegian national cultural heritage monument,  log driving museum, and wetland 
                    center at the outlet of the Glomma River into Lake oyeren in Fetsund in Viken country. The Fetsund Booms
                    were set up as a timber sorting facility in 1861 and operated until 1985, when log driving came to an end 
                    on the Glomma River. Today the facility is part of the Akershus Museum.

                <h2>My brother, Antony</h2>
                 <p>This picture was taken during a road trip to Aalesund.
                     This picture shows my brother, Antony, and in front of him is the beautiful city of Geiranger.
                     Antony was the main driver for the trip, and we can clearly see that he was tired from the driving because he would rather look at his phone than the magnificent view from the vantage point.

                 <p>What is more beautiful than the sunset view on a perfect summer day.
                     I found myself lucky to attend this sunset personally.
                     I didn't see ever such a nice view of the sunset. You feel your dreams coming true at moments like this.

                 <p>I took this picture without any filter in my phone when I was going with my friends 
                     on a fishing trip in Sunndalsore last summer. I loved this view of the sea between the mountains,
                     the view was incredibly nice, as if it were a drawing, not reality.

                     where we were in trip to the west of Norway (Bergen) we spend whole 5 fanny nights in Crazy way.
                     Most of our time was in forest and sleeping in tent we didn't got a hotel room.
                     It was Wilde life for best five nights ever.
